Hello! If you're going to use Python to run the JSON Editor instead of installing the standalone app, please follow
the instructions below.

1) Install Python 3.5 or higher. Visit the below link and follow the instructions to download Python.
   Choose a version that is 3.5 or higher or the code will not work.

2) Once Python has installed properly, verify that it has done so by opening the command prompt.
   Click the start menu and type "cmd" to open it.
   Type "py" and it should display the python version and take you into an interactive python shell.
   Type "exit()" to get out.

   If the "py" command does not work, you will need to add a link to your PATH environment for Python.
   See the below link for instructions on how to do so ONLY IF THE "PY" COMMAND DID NOT WORK.

3) Install sip and pyqt5.
   In the cmd window, type:

   py -m pip install sip

   Let that install and then type:

   py -m pip install pyqt5

   You now have the required gui library for the code.

 4) To run the program, simply double click on the "mainWindow.py" file in the provided .zip.
